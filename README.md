Scheduling algorithms for different processes in Operating system

There are different scheduling algorithms used for scheduling the processes in an Operating system. Based on Tanenbaum's and 
Galvin's explanations about different scheduling algorithms which are present in an Operating system, this project produces a 
simulation of those algorithms by making a fun android application.
